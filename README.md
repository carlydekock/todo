# Lab 34: ```<Login />``` and ```<Auth />```

To Do List Manager Phase 1: Begin the build of an application designed for creating and organizing a “To Do” list in your browser.

To Do List Manager Phase 2: Connecting the To Do Application to an external API and Database

To Do List Manager Phase 3: Add some configuration settings to the application
In this phase, we’ll be adding some top-level settings for the application, so that the user can make some display choices that the app will use by default.

To Do List Manager Phase 4: Adding security and access controls to the application. In this final phase, we’ll be requiring that users be logged in, in order to see the to do items. Additionally, based on their user type, they will be allowed (or denied) to perform actions such as editing or deleting them.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
